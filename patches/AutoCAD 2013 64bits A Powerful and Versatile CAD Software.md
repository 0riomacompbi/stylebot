In this article, we will review some of the key features and benefits of AutoCAD 2013 64bits, and why you should consider upgrading to this version if you haven't already.
 
## New DWG File Format
 
One of the major changes in AutoCAD 2013 is the introduction of a new DWG file format, which is compatible with previous versions of AutoCAD from 2010 to 2012. The new format offers improved performance, security, and reliability, as well as support for new features such as cloud connectivity, point cloud data, and model documentation[^1^].
 
If you need to share your drawings with users of older versions of AutoCAD, you can easily save them in a compatible format using the Save As command. You can also use the DWG TrueView application to view and convert DWG files for free.
 
## Cloud Connectivity
 
Another major feature of AutoCAD 2013 is the integration with Autodesk's cloud services, which allow you to access, store, and share your drawings online. You can use the Autodesk 360 service to sync your files across multiple devices, collaborate with others in real time, and access additional tools and content. You can also use the Autodesk Exchange Apps service to download and install apps that extend the functionality of AutoCAD.
 
To use these services, you need to sign in with your Autodesk ID, which you can create for free. You also get a free storage space of up to 3 GB on Autodesk 360. You can access these services from within AutoCAD using the Online tab on the ribbon.
 
## Point Cloud Data
 
AutoCAD 2013 also supports point cloud data, which are sets of points that represent the shape of a physical object or space. You can import point cloud data from various sources, such as laser scanners, cameras, or photogrammetry software, and use them as references for your drawings. You can also attach point cloud data to your drawings as external references.
 
AutoCAD 2013 offers improved performance and visualization for point cloud data, as well as new tools for cropping, clipping, snapping, and creating sections. You can also use point cloud data to create surfaces and solids using the Point Cloud Modeling toolset[^2^].
 
## Model Documentation
 
Another new feature of AutoCAD 2013 is the model documentation toolset, which allows you to create 2D drawings from 3D models automatically. You can import 3D models from various sources, such as Inventor, SolidWorks, CATIA, Pro/ENGINEER, Rhino, or SketchUp, and use them as base views for your drawings. You can also create projected views, section views, detail views, and annotations from your base views.
 
The model documentation toolset offers several advantages over manual drawing creation, such as accuracy, consistency, and efficiency. You can also update your drawings automatically when you make changes to your 3D models[^3^].
 
## Conclusion
 
AutoCAD 2013 64bits is a powerful and versatile CAD software that offers many new and enhanced features and functions for creating stunning 2D and 3D drawings. Whether you are a professional or a hobbyist, AutoCAD 2013 can help you achieve your design goals with ease and precision.
