If you want to play Age of Empires Gold Edition on your modern PC, you might encounter some issues, such as low resolution, color bugs, or the need for a CD. Fortunately, there are some solutions that can help you enjoy this game in HD quality and without a CD.
 
One of them is UPatch HD, an unofficial patch that revamps the game with HD resolution, HD interface graphics, hundreds of bug fixes, new gameplay options, and many other enhancements[^4^]. You can download UPatch HD from its official site or from Mod DB[^6^]. To install it, you need to have Age of Empires Gold Edition installed on your PC. Then, just run the UPatch HD installer and follow the instructions. UPatch HD will automatically detect your game version and language and apply the appropriate patch. You can also use the UPatch HD Launcher to customize your settings and manage your mods.
 
Another solution is to use a no-CD/fixed EXE file that allows you to run the game without inserting the CD. You can find such files on various websites, such as GameCopyWorld[^5^]. However, be careful when downloading and using these files, as they might contain viruses or malware. Always scan them with an antivirus program before running them. To use a no-CD/fixed EXE file, you need to replace the original EMPIRES.EXE and EMPIRESX.EXE files in your game folder with the ones from the file archive. Make sure to backup your original files before doing this.
 
With these solutions, you should be able to play Age of Empires Gold Edition with HD graphics and no CD. Have fun!

If you want to improve your skills and strategies in Age of Empires Gold Edition, here are some tips and tricks that might help you:
 
- Pay attention to areas of influence around buildings. Some buildings, such as the Mill, the Town Center, or the Castle, have an area of influence that affects nearby units and structures. For example, farms built within the Mill's area of influence will produce more food and be more resistant to raids[^1^]. You can see the area of influence by selecting a building and looking at the green circle around it.
- Use hotkeys and control groups. Hotkeys are keyboard shortcuts that allow you to quickly perform actions without clicking on menus or buttons. For example, pressing H will select your Town Center, while pressing B will open the building menu. Control groups are groups of units or buildings that you can assign to a number key for easy selection. For example, pressing Ctrl+1 will assign the selected units to group 1, while pressing 1 will select them. You can use hotkeys and control groups to save time and multitask more efficiently.
- Scout your map and your enemies. Scouting is essential for gathering information about your surroundings and your opponents. You can use scout units, such as cavalry or ships, to explore the map and reveal resources, terrain features, relics, and enemy locations. Scouting can help you plan your economy, your defense, and your attacks. You can also use spies or monks to infiltrate enemy bases and see what they are doing.
- Balance your economy and your military. A good player knows how to manage both their economy and their military. You need a strong economy to produce resources and support your army. You need a strong army to protect your economy and attack your enemies. You should always try to keep your villagers working on different resources, depending on your needs and your civilization's bonuses. You should also try to keep your military units active and use them for raiding, defending, or pushing.
- Learn the strengths and weaknesses of each civilization. Age of Empires Gold Edition features 16 civilizations, each with their own unique units, technologies, bonuses, and playstyles. Some civilizations are better at certain aspects of the game than others. For example, the Romans have cheaper buildings and faster infantry, while the Persians have faster villagers and stronger elephants. You should learn the advantages and disadvantages of each civilization and how to counter them with your own.

These are some basic tips and tricks that can help you improve your game in Age of Empires Gold Edition. However, the best way to learn is by playing and practicing. Try different civilizations, maps, modes, and strategies. Watch replays or streams of other players. Join online communities and forums for more advice and feedback. And most importantly, have fun!
